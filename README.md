📌 This repository contains Java implementations of the **SOLID principles**, which are fundamental to writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code. Each principle is **implemented and explained through a clear, real-world example**, making it easy to understand how to apply each one in practical situations.

## 📌 About  

The **SOLID** principles are a set of five object-oriented design principles that help developers write cleaner, more maintainable, and scalable code. These principles are:

1. **S** - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)  
2. **O** - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)  
3. **L** - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)  
4. **I** - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)  
5. **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

This repository provides **Java implementations** and **real-world examples** of each of these principles to help developers understand how to properly apply them in software development.

## 🚀 SOLID Principles Implemented  

### 🧩 **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**  
✔️ Example of a class that has one reason to change (i.e., a single responsibility).  

### 🔒 **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**  
✔️ Example demonstrating how to extend functionality without modifying existing code.

### 🔄 **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**  
✔️ Example showing how derived classes should be substitutable for their base class.

### 🛠️ **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**  
✔️ Example showing how to prefer many smaller interfaces over a few larger ones.

### 🔌 **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**  
✔️ Example showing how high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but on abstractions.
